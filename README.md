# Aeraki

A framework to help you build a service mesh that can understand any layer 7 protocols used by the services.

Aeraki is the Greek word for 'breeze'. While Istio connects microservices deployed in Kubernetes, Aeraki provides a framework to allow Istio to support more layer 7 protocols other than HTTP and gRPC.
